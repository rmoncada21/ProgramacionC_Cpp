## 1. Write a C program to compute the sum of the two input values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.

## 3. Write a C program that checks two given integers and returns true if at least one of them is 30 or if their sum is 30. In other words, if either of the two integers is 30 or if  their sum equals 30, the program will return true

## 5. Write a C program that checks if a positive integer is divisible by either 3 or 7, or both. If the integer is a  multiple of 3, then the program will return true. Similarly, if the integer is a multiple of 7, then also the program will return true. If the integer is not a multiple of 3 or 7, then the program will return false

## 7. Write a C program to check two given integers whether either of them is in the range 100..200 inclusive.

## 9. Write a C program that checks if three given integers are in the range of 20 to 50 (inclusive) and returns true if at least one of them is within the range. If none of the integers are within the range, the program returns false.

## 13. Write a C program to check if two given non-negative integers have the same last digit.

## 19. Write a C program that checks if a given non-negative integer is a multiple of 13 or one more than a multiple of 13. For example, if the given integer is 26 or 27, the program will return true, but if it is 25 or 28, the program will return false.

## 25. Write a C program to check if two or more nonnegative integers have the same lesftmost (mas a la izquierda) digit.
