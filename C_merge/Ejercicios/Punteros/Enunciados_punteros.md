# 1. Write a program in C to show the basic declaration of a pointer.
Expected Output :

Pointer : Show the basic declaration of pointer :

Here is m=10, n and o are two integer variable and *z is an integer

z stores the address of m  = 0x7ffd40630d44                                                         
*z stores the value of m = 10                                                          
&m is the address of m = 0x7ffd40630d44                                              
&n stores the address of n = 0x7ffd40630d48                                                                  
&o  stores the address of o = 0x7ffd40630d4c

&z stores the address of z = 0x7ffd40630d50 


# 3. Write a program in C to demonstrate the use of the &(address of) and *(value at address) operators.
Expected Output :

Pointer : Demonstrate the use of & and * operator:
           
 m = 300
 fx = 300.600006           
 cht = z
           
Using & operator :  


 address of m = 0x7ffda2eeeec8    
 address of fx = 0x7ffda2eeeecc                                               
 address of cht = 0x7ffda2eeeec7  
                                                                               
Using & and * operator :

value at address of m = 300
value at address of fx = 300.600006
                                  
value at address of cht = z
Using only pointer variable:

 address of m = 0x7ffda2eeeec8    
 address of fx = 0x7ffda2eeeecc

 address of cht = 0x7ffda2eeeec7
Using only pointer operator :                          
value at address of m = 300

value at address of fx= 300.600006

value at address of cht= z

Test Data :
Input the first number : 5
Input the second number : 6
Expected Output :

The sum of 5 and 6  is 11

# 11. Write a program in C to swap elements using call by reference.
Test Data :
Input the value of 1st element : 5
Input the value of 2nd element : 6
Input the value of 3rd element : 7
Expected Output :

# 13. Write a program in C to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string using a pointer.
Test Data :
Input a string: string
Expected Output :

Number of vowels : 1
Number of constant : 5

# 15. Write a C program to demonstrate how a function returns a pointer.
Test Data :
Input the first number : 5
Input the second number : 6
Expected Output :

 The number 6 is larger. 

 # 17. Write a program in C to print the elements of an array in reverse order.
Test Data :
Input the number of elements to store in the array (max 15) : 5
Input 5 number of elements in the array :
element - 1 : 2
element - 2 : 3
element - 3 : 4
element - 4 : 5
element - 5 : 6
Expected Output :

 The elements of array in reverse order are :
 element - 5 : 6     
 element - 4 : 5     
 element - 3 : 4     
 element - 2 : 3
 element - 1 : 2
