# 1. Write a program in C to show the basic declaration of a pointer.
Expected Output :

Pointer : Show the basic declaration of pointer :

Here is m=10, n and o are two integer variable and *z is an integer

z stores the address of m  = 0x7ffd40630d44                                                         
*z stores the value of m = 10                                                          
&m is the address of m = 0x7ffd40630d44                                              
&n stores the address of n = 0x7ffd40630d48                                                                  
&o  stores the address of o = 0x7ffd40630d4c

&z stores the address of z = 0x7ffd40630d50 


# 3. Write a program in C to demonstrate the use of the &(address of) and *(value at address) operators.
Expected Output :

Pointer : Demonstrate the use of & and * operator:
           
 m = 300
 fx = 300.600006           
 cht = z
           
Using & operator :  


 address of m = 0x7ffda2eeeec8    
 address of fx = 0x7ffda2eeeecc                                               
 address of cht = 0x7ffda2eeeec7  
                                                                               
Using & and * operator :

value at address of m = 300
value at address of fx = 300.600006
                                  
value at address of cht = z
Using only pointer variable:

 address of m = 0x7ffda2eeeec8    
 address of fx = 0x7ffda2eeeecc

 address of cht = 0x7ffda2eeeec7
Using only pointer operator :                          
value at address of m = 300

value at address of fx= 300.600006

value at address of cht= z

# 5. Write a program in C to add numbers using call by reference.
Test Data :
Input the first number : 5
Input the second number : 6
Expected Output :

The sum of 5 and 6  is 11
